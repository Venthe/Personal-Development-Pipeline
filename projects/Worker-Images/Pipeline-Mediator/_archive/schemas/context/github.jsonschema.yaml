components:
  action:
    type: string
    description: >
      The name of the action currently running, or the id of a step. GitHub removes special characters, and uses the name __run when the current step runs a script without an id. If you use the same action more than once in the same job, the name will include a suffix with the sequence number with underscore before it. For example, the first script you run will have the name __run, and the second script will be named __run_2. Similarly, the second invocation of actions/checkout will be actionscheckout2.
  action_path:
    type: string
    description: >
      The path where an action is located. This property is only supported in composite actions. You can use this path to access files located in the same repository as the action, for example by changing directories to the path: cd ${{ github.action_path }} .
  action_ref:
    type: string
    description: >
      For a step executing an action, this is the ref of the action being executed. For example, v2.

      Do not use in the run context. To make this context work with composite actions, reference it within the env context of the composite action.
  action_repository:
    type: string
    description: >
      For a step executing an action, this is the owner and repository name of the action. For example, actions/checkout.

      Do not use in the run context. To make this context work with composite actions, reference it within the env context of the composite action.
  action_status:
    type: string
    description: >
      For a composite action, the current result of the composite action.
  actor:
    type: string
    description: >
      The username of the user that triggered the initial workflow run. If the workflow run is a re-run, this value may differ from github.triggering_actor. Any workflow re-runs will use the privileges of github.actor, even if the actor initiating the re-run (github.triggering_actor) has different privileges.
  actor_id:
    type: string
    description: >
      The account ID of the person or app that triggered the initial workflow run. For example, 1234567. Note that this is different from the actor username.
  api_url:
    type: string
    description: >
      The URL of the GitHub REST API.
  base_ref:
    type: string
    description: >
      The base_ref or target branch of the pull request in a workflow run. This property is only available when the event that triggers a workflow run is either pull_request or pull_request_target.
  env:
    type: string
    description: >
      Path on the runner to the file that sets environment variables from workflow commands. This file is unique to the current step and is a different file for each step in a job. For more information, see "Workflow commands for GitHub Actions."
  event:
    type: object
    description: >
      The full event webhook payload. You can access individual properties of the event using this context. This object is identical to the webhook payload of the event that triggered the workflow run, and is different for each event. The webhooks for each GitHub Actions event is linked in "Events that trigger workflows." For example, for a workflow run triggered by the push event, this object contains the contents of the push webhook payload.
  event_name:
    type: string
    description: >
      The name of the event that triggered the workflow run.
  event_path:
    type: string
    description: >
      The path to the file on the runner that contains the full event webhook payload.
  graphql_url:
    type: string
    description: >
      The URL of the GitHub GraphQL API.
  head_ref:
    type: string
    description: >
      The head_ref or source branch of the pull request in a workflow run. This property is only available when the event that triggers a workflow run is either pull_request or pull_request_target.
  job:
    type: string
    description: >
      The job_id of the current job.
      Note: This context property is set by the Actions runner, and is only available within the execution steps of a job. Otherwise, the value of this property will be null.
  path:
    type: string
    description: >
      Path on the runner to the file that sets system PATH variables from workflow commands. This file is unique to the current step and is a different file for each step in a job. For more information, see "Workflow commands for GitHub Actions."
  ref:
    type: string
    description: >
      The fully-formed ref of the branch or tag that triggered the workflow run. For workflows triggered by push, this is the branch or tag ref that was pushed. For workflows triggered by pull_request, this is the pull request merge branch. For workflows triggered by release, this is the release tag created. For other triggers, this is the branch or tag ref that triggered the workflow run. This is only set if a branch or tag is available for the event type. The ref given is fully-formed, meaning that for branches the format is refs/heads/<branch_name>, for pull requests it is refs/pull/<pr_number>/merge, and for tags it is refs/tags/<tag_name>. For example, refs/heads/feature-branch-1.
  ref_name:
    type: string
    description: >
      The short ref name of the branch or tag that triggered the workflow run. This value matches the branch or tag name shown on GitHub. For example, feature-branch-1.

      For pull requests, the format is refs/pull/<pr_number>/merge.
  ref_protected:
    type: boolean
    description: >
      true if branch protections or rulesets are configured for the ref that triggered the workflow run.
  ref_type:
    type: string
    description: >
      The type of ref that triggered the workflow run. Valid values are branch or tag.
  repository:
    type: string
    description: >
      The owner and repository name. For example, octocat/Hello-World.
  repository_id:
    type: string
    description: >
      The ID of the repository. For example, 123456789. Note that this is different from the repository name.
  repository_owner:
    type: string
    description: >
      The repository owner's username. For example, octocat.
  repository_owner_id:
    type: string
    description: >
      The repository owner's account ID. For example, 1234567. Note that this is different from the owner's name.
  repositoryUrl:
    type: string
    description: >
      The Git URL to the repository. For example, git://github.com/octocat/hello-world.git.
  retention_days:
    type: string
    description: >
      The number of days that workflow run logs and artifacts are kept.
  run_id:
    type: string
    description: >
      A unique number for each workflow run within a repository. This number does not change if you re-run the workflow run.
  run_number:
    type: string
    description: >
      A unique number for each run of a particular workflow in a repository. This number begins at 1 for the workflow's first run, and increments with each new run. This number does not change if you re-run the workflow run.
  run_attempt:
    type: string
    description: >
      A unique number for each attempt of a particular workflow run in a repository. This number begins at 1 for the workflow run's first attempt, and increments with each re-run.
  secret_source:
    type: string
    description: >
      The source of a secret used in a workflow. Possible values are None, Actions, Codespaces, or Dependabot.
  server_url:
    type: string

  sha:
    type: string
    pattern: \b[0-9a-f]{5,40}\b
    description: >
      The commit SHA that triggered the workflow. The value of this commit SHA depends on the event that triggered the workflow. For more information, see "Events that trigger workflows." For example, ffac537e6cbbf934b08745a378932722df287a53.
  token:

  triggering_actor:
    type: string
    description: >
      The username of the user that initiated the workflow run. If the workflow run is a re-run, this value may differ from github.actor. Any workflow re-runs will use the privileges of github.actor, even if the actor initiating the re-run (github.triggering_actor) has different privileges.
