# This event occurs when a workflow run is requested or completed. It allows you to execute a workflow based on
# execution or completion of another workflow. The workflow started by the workflow_run event is able to access secrets
# and write tokens, even if the previous workflow was not. This is useful in cases where the previous workflow is
# intentionally not privileged, but you need to take a privileged action in a later workflow.
