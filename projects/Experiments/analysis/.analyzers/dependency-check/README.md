Dependency-Check Command Line
================
Dependency-Check Command Line can be used to check project dependencies for published security vulnerabilities. The checks
performed are a "best effort" and as such, there could be false positives as well as false negatives. However,
vulnerabilities in 3rd party components is a well-known problem and is currently documented in the 2021 OWASP
Top 10 as [A06:2021 â€“ Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/).

Documentation and links to production binary releases can be found on the [github pages](http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-cli/index.html).
